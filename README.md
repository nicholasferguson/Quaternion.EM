I coded up in python, several preliminary equations from Jack’s article
“Physical Space as a Quaternion Structure, I Maxwell Equations. A Brief Note” by Jack P.M<br>

This code has issues with the following equalities:<br>
[d/dr, B] = +{d/dr, E} (13)<br>

[d/dr, E] = -{d/dr, B} (14)<br>

d/dr → (d/dr → A) + (A ← d/dr) ← d/dr = 0 (22)<br>

d/dr → (d/dr → A) + (A ← d/dr) ← d/dr = 8πJ   (24)<br>

Will upload corrections, when I have them.<br>
